🧠 The 6-Step Problem-Solving Process  
1. **Understand and Define the Problem**  
Before jumping into coding, it's crucial to grasp the problem fully. In our fruit vendor scenario, the task is to filter out rotten fruits from an array like `["apple", "rottenBanana", "mango"]`. Understanding the exact requirements ensures we address the right issue.  

2. **Divide the Problem**  
Break the main problem into smaller, manageable tasks:  
- Declare the array of fruits.  
- Define a function to filter out rotten fruits.  
- Implement the filtering logic.  
This approach simplifies complex problems and makes them more approachable.  

3. **Finding the Right Technique**  
Identify suitable techniques or methods to solve the problem. In this case:  
- Use the `filter()` method to iterate over the array.  
- Apply the `includes()` method to check for the substring `"rotten"`.  
These techniques are well-documented and widely used in JavaScript.  

4. **Experiment**  
Before applying the solution to the entire dataset, test it on smaller examples to ensure it works as expected. This step helps in understanding the behavior of the chosen methods.  

5. **Debug**  
If the code doesn't work as intended:  
- Carefully read any error messages; they often pinpoint the issue.  
- Check for common mistakes like typos (`include` vs. `includes`).  
- Use debugging tools or `console.log` to trace the problem.  
For instance, correcting `fruit.include("rotten")` to `fruit.includes("rotten")` resolves the issue.  

6. **Reflect**  
After solving the problem:  
- Review the code for readability and efficiency.  
- Consider alternative solutions or improvements.  
- Reflect on what worked well and what could be improved for future problems.  

🍎 **Fruit Vendor Example**  
```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "rottenBanana", "mango"];

const takeOutRottenFruit = (arrayOfFruits) => {
  return arrayOfFruits.filter(fruit => !fruit.includes("rotten"));
};

console.log(takeOutRottenFruit(fruits)); // ["apple", "mango"]

This function filters out any fruit containing the substring "rotten".
